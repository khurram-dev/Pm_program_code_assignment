This is my practice AI program.  
I am still learning AI programming and my understanding is not much, but I tried to build this project.  

## What it does
- The program has a **Coordinator Agent**.  
- The coordinator takes the user question and sends it to the **Research Node**.  
- The research node searches Wikipedia for the question.  
- The results are then passed to the **Analyze Node**.  
- The analyze node creates a simple summary from the Wikipedia content.  

## Why I made this
I wanted to practice using AI agents step by step.  
This project is very basic, but it helped me understand how an agent can search and then summarize information.
